This repository is dedicated to personal tests, creating portfolio, developing and trying new html-css-js things, and to continue remembering those things that we ever forget as time goes by.

## Portfolio

I'm continuously trying new things. In my free time I'm developing this repository to be my portfolio, adding the projects and creating a practical and easy-to-navigate website.

## Personal test place

I'm really so sorry if you expected for something entirely built, without bugs, errors, neither web-mobile failures. I'm trying to create something new and testing new features here. I started using Bootstrap 4, but now we are with the version 5, for instance. Many things changed and this is part of what to be developer is. I'm very happy with all these learnings that I'm walking through.

## The learning

As everybody knows, we forget too many things that we don't want to forget and remember things that we want to forget, lol. However, a way, not the best way, but a way to remember those things that we learned is practicing, practicing a lot. Because of our jobs and things of our lives we don't practice what we want to practice, this website is something exciting and a good chance to put some effort to not forget. Well, we programmers use to search a lot, but sometimes it's good for us if we know something about the way or how we must solve the problems in front of us. The base is very important as well, in the matter of fact the most important thing, this is the thing we need to practice, the rest comes easily afterward.
