    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am Physicist, and MSc, and PhD in Physics from Federal University of Paran치, Brazil. I worked for over 12 years in multidisciplinary groups, being considered a noteworthy in the academic research space. I have over 10 years of experience in microscopy, photonics, biophysics, prototyping, and microfluidics engineering. Last years, I entered the Python World to explore my passion for programming and data analysis. Physics corroborated my critical and creative analytical thinking, which makes me an adaptive professional in several areas and groups. I completed a 36 hours UX Design course in august this year, increasing my skills in this area which were acquired in my job with the diagnostic system at the IBMP.</p>
